# TPLSp 1.1.0

Python Package for using Thresholded Partial Least Squares (TPLS) for big data regression and classification.
It is developed with whole-brain neuroimaging (fMRI) MVPA predictors in mind. TPLS uses analytical calulations
of partial least squares to dramatically speed-up the training of models with large number of features (~millions).

You can install from pypi using pip:
pip install --upgrade TPLSp

Look under the examples folderin github for step-by-step tutorial on how to use TPLS.
